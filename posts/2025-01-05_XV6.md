## Inspect a user-process page table
### General knowledge:
> Since xv6 is running on Sv39 RISC-V, only the bottom **39 bits** of 64-bit virtual address are used; the top 25 bits are not used. Within 39 bits, there are **27 bits** are used for Page Table Entry (PTE) index; the other **12 bits** are used for the offset.

> Each PTE contains a 44-bit physical page number (PPN) and 10-bit flags.

Given the PTE value, we can calculate the Physical Page Number (PPN) by the following:
```c
#define PTE2PA(pte) (((pte) >> 10) << 12)
```
- Right shift 10 bits to remove the flags
- Left shift 12 bits to align with the physical address where the bottom 12 bits are used for offset.

Given the PTE value, we can get the PTE Flags by the following:
```c
#define PTE_FLAGS(pte) ((pte) & 0x3FF)
```
- By using bit-wise AND with 0x3FF (001111111111), we can zero all the bits in the PTE except for the first 10 bits, representing the FLAGS.

A typical PTE in RISC-V has the following format:

| Bit Position | Name  | Description                                |
|--------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0            | V     | Indicates if the PTE is valid.             |
| 1            | R     | Page is readable.                          |
| 2            | W     | Page is writable.                          |
| 3            | X     | Page is executable.                        |
| 4            | U     | Accessible in user mode.                   |
| 5            | G     | Shared across all address spaces.          |
| 6            | A     | Set by hardware on the first access.       |
| 7            | D     | Set by hardware on the first write.        |
| 8-9          |       | Reserved for future use.                   |
| 10-53        | PPN   | Physical page number (mapping to memory).  |
| 54-63        |       | Reserved for future use.                   |

### Solution:
Approach:

1. Using the PTE format to decode the permission.
2. Using the order of virtual address to determine the page content since they are allocated in order.

| PTE entry                                          | Content      | Permission        |

## Speed up system calls 
### General knowledge:
> System calls usually require a context switch from user mode to kernel mode, which is expensive.
> To speed up the certain system calls, we use a technique called
> **virtual dynamic shared object** (vDSO).
> vDSO is a kernel mechanism for exporting a carefully **selected set of kernel space 
> routines** to user space applications so that applications can call these kernel space routines in-process, without incurring 
> the performance penalty of a mode switch from user mode to kernel mode that is inherent when calling these same kernel space 
> routines by means of the system call interface.

Besides,
we should also understand
how xv6 **allocates pages** to the process and how the **virtual memory mapping to the physical memory.**

**TBU:** explain those concepts.

### Solution:
- `ugetpid()` is declared in the file `user/user.h`, thus any user program can call it.
- Also, the definition of `ugetpid()` is defined in the `user/ulib.c` file as follows:
```c
int
ugetpid(void)
{
  struct usyscall *u = (struct usyscall *)USYSCALL;
  return u->pid;
}
```
From the definition, we can see that the `pid` is stored in the `usyscall` structure, which is defined in `kernel/memlayout.h` as follows:
```c
struct usyscall {
  int pid;  // Process ID
};
```
The problem description suggests that:
> When each process is created, map one read-only page at USYSCALL. At the start of this page, store a struct usyscall

The `USYSCALL` is defined in the `kernel/memlayout.h` as follows:
```c
#define USYSCALL (TRAPFRAME - PGSIZE)
```
That means the `struct usyscall` is stored in the page right after the `TRAPFRAME` page. 

To do that, we have to deep into the function where the memory is allocated for the process. In this case, it is the 
```alloproc``` function defined in `kernel/proc.c`.
```c
static struct proc*
allocproc(void) {
  ...
}
```
The `allocproc` uses the function `kalloc` to allocate 4096-byte page in physical memory to process's component. For
example, this is the line where a single page in physical memory is allocated for the process's trapframe.

```c
p->trapframe = (struct trapframe *)kalloc()
```
After this line, the `p->trapframe` contains the memory of the page a.k.a.
It plays as a pointer to the page in physical memory.

Thus, to allocate a page for the `struct usyscall`, we can use the following code:
```c
if((p->usyscall = (struct usyscall *)kalloc()) == 0){
  freeproc(p) ;
  release(&p->lock);
  return 0;
}
```
We also assign the process ID to the `usyscall` structure as follows:
```c
p->usyscall->pid = p->pid;
```

Then we map the physical address to virtual address of the process via the function `proc_pagetable` defined in the 
file `kernel/proc.c`.
```c
 if(mappages(pagetable, USYSCALL, PGSIZE,
              (uint64)(p->usyscall), PTE_R | PTE_U) < 0) {
      uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAMPOLINE, 1, 0);
      uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME, 1, 0);
      uvmfree(pagetable, 0);
      return 0;
  }
```
The function `mappages` is used to create a pagetable entry for the given physical address.

After the mapping is successful, the system can use the pagetable to convert the virtual address into physical address.
That it's. The rest of the code is to clean up the memory when freeing the process, which is defined in the `freeproc` function.

```c
static void
freeproc(struct proc *p)
{
  ...
  if(p->usyscall)
    kfree((void*)p->usyscall);
  ...
}
```

## Print a page table 
### General knowledge:
> Xv6 uses a three-level pagetable. For each level, there are 2^9 (512) entries.
> The first and second level entries contain the physical addresses for page-table pages in the lower level, while the 
> lowest level entries contain the physical page number (PPN).

> The pagetable entries are stored sequentially in the memory as follows:
```
| Level2_Entry0 | Level1_Entry0 | Level0_Entry0 | ... | Level2_Entry1 | Level1_Entry0 | Level0_Entry0 | ...    
```
Thus, the gap between 2 PTE varies by level:
- Level 2 entries: 512 * 512 * PGSIZE
- Level 1 entries: 512 * PGSIZE
- Level 0 entries: PGSIZE

> The virtual address of the first pagetable entry is 0, which is set in the `uvmfirst` function.
```c
void
uvmfirst(pagetable_t pagetable, uchar *src, uint sz)
{
  char *mem;

  if(sz >= PGSIZE)
    panic("uvmfirst: more than a page");
  mem = kalloc();
  memset(mem, 0, PGSIZE);
  mappages(pagetable, 0, PGSIZE, (uint64)mem, PTE_W|PTE_R|PTE_X|PTE_U);
  memmove(mem, src, sz);
}
```

### Solution:

```c
void
vmprint_helper(pagetable_t pagetable, uint64 level, uint64 va) {
  uint64 sz = 0;
  if (level == 2) sz = 512 * 512 * PGSIZE; 
  else if (level == 1) sz = 512 * PGSIZE;
  else sz = PGSIZE;
  for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++, va += sz) {
    pte_t pte = *(pagetable + i); // Dereference the pagetable pointer to get the pagetable entry content
    if ((pte & PTE_V) == 0) continue;
    for (int j = 0; j < 3 - level; ++j) printf(" ..");
    printf("%p: pte %p pa %p\n", (void *) va, (void *) pte, (void *) PTE2PA(pte));
    if (PTE_LEAF(pte) == 0) // if it is not the leave
   		vmprint_helper((void *) PTE2PA(pte), level - 1, va);
  }
}
```
